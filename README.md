# ðŸ«† nix-fingerprint

A little collection of helpers that exploit leaked impurities in nix to gather
information about the underlying system in pure evaluation mode.

Also contains some [other oddities](./lib/extras.nix) we found.

Example:

```
# In pure eval mode
$ nix eval github:oddlama/nix-fingerprint#lib.estimatedCurrentSystems
[ "x86_64-linux" ]
```
